Transpose of a directed graph G is another directed graph 
on the same set of vertices with all of the edges reversed 
compared to the orientation of the corresponding edges in G. 
That is, if G contains an edge (u, v) then the 
converse/transpose/reverse of G contains an edge (v, u) 
and vice versa.
Given a graph (represented as adjacency list), we need 
to find another graph which is the transpose of the given graph.
